# react-boilerplate
This is a react-boilerplate created for personal learning

![Main workflow](https://github.com/irfan-maulana-tkp/react-boilerplate/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/irfan-maulana-tkp/react-boilerplate/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/irfan-maulana-tkp/react-boilerplate)

It includes some dummy components to help you get started and understand the boilerplate structure.

## What it includes
- [x] Apollo
  > A platform for building a data graph
- [x] Jest
  > Task runner for doing tests
- [x] React-testing-library
  > Library to test react component
- [x] React-emotion
  > Easy CSS in JS solution, no more worrying about DOM elements being loaded before CSS
- [x] Webpack-dev-server + react-hot-loader
  > Development server with hot reload capabilities
- [x] Eslint rules and prettier rules
  > Highly opinionated rules (from work experiences and my personal preferences)
- [x] React router (v5)
  > The defacto routing solution for react app
- [x] Component based code splitting
